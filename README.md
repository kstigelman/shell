# Shell
Small, simple shell program written in C for an Operating System course.

This shell will recognize and run command-line commands from user input.
There are also two built-in commands:
- quit - Exits the shell. Can not terminate the program normally with Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z as these signals are blocked.
- fg - Brings the background process to the foreground.
